          <p>Hello and welcome back to another progress update! We know that it has been a while since the last update, but thatâ€™s what happens when holidays arise and some much needed time is taken to kick back, relax and take a break from our day to day routine. With that said, a new semester has started back up and we are getting back to work on Project Exiled.
            <br /><br />
            With the break, we did make a little bit of progress on the game itself, however, a lot of it had to do with updating to Unity 2018.3. With this came a lot of optimizations to our game, as well as some visual changes. Additionally, we made some progress through our long list of known issues, however, we discovered plenty more along the way. As far as new features are concerned, we have begun to implement our research and tech tree system. This should help limit the pace of progression throughout the game, as well as provide a template for which steps to take next in order to continuously advance. Of course with all of the new features that we add we will be making constant changes and tweaks as we see fit.
            <br /><br />
            Be sure to follow us on Instagram and Twitter, as we will be starting to make more posts there as to updates on the game, as well as anything else that we are working on. But as always, we will continue to update our progress on this blog as well.
            <br /><br />
            Lastly, its an older download, however, a lot of the key features we would like people to try out are there. Feel free to provide us feedback with the form provided on the main menu of the game. Again, we are really just looking for feedback on how the systems themselves feel and if they are smooth and intuitive. Feel free to list any bugs you find, however, as this is an older download, there is a good chance we have tweaked and fixed them. We are not quite sure how often we want to provide downloads of the current game, so we will not be making any promises at this point, however, if your interested in getting more up-to-date versions of the game, please send us an email about inquiring to be an alpha tester.
