          <p>It has been over 2 years of work since my initial prototype build for this game, and boy have we come a long way! Huge amounts of improvements, loads of new features, and a visual overhaul!
            <br /><br />
            This project started as a summer hobby to help me dive deeper into what Unity had to offer. Previously, I had been working on some simple mobiles games, which really just felt like I was dragging around a lot of different components and game objects in the inspector and so I wanted to do something more challenging, something that would force me to learn new techniques. The initial idea for this project consisted of a banished like game style, where you would tell your citizens what to harvest, and then which buildings to build. For a while, that’s all it was. I remember being so excited that I had come up with this technique to implement AI to harvest resources and construct buildings. It was only later when I started to scale past 4-5 citizens at a time, while adding new tasks like farming, eating, etc, that I realized how clunky and poor performing that the system was, but that’s what this project was about. It was, and still is, learning moments like these that inspire me to keep pushing on in my free time.
            <br /><br />
            So where are we now? The game has come a long way. With inspiration pulled from all of my favorite colony managements games like Rim World and Banished, it has really developed into something more then just a project, as its finally taking shape into the form of a game. Research trees, farming, building, procedural generated worlds, crafting systems, inventories, combat, a custom built task management system that is easily expandable and so much more, we really have come a long way.
            <br /><br />
            So that’s that. Just wanted to take the time to look back at where I have come from with this project, and highlight all of the progress I have made. Because to me, it has been quite a journey, and I look forward to everything that this project has to bring me. Maybe in another 2 years, by the time I am wrapping up my college career, I will have finished this project and will have the ability to share it with all of you. So thanks for checking in, and until next time.
