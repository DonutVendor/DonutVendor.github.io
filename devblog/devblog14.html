          <p>We are back with another update, and boy is it a big one! In the past month, we have been hard at work really polishing out the features we currently have and making sure they all work together. With a plethora of bugs fixed and a large portion of the gameplay being tied together, we have seriously made significant progress this month. However, with that said, we still do not feel that the game is ready to be released in a pre-alpha state. We want the first release to have feedback centered around the actual gameplay and mechanics, rather then small nitpicks here and there that we already have plans to change. Over the course of this next month, we will be continuing to refine the game and fix many of the bugs and give the game a much more polished feel. Either way, we will be releasing a download next month, as we do believe that it is crucial to get feedback on the game early on in development rather than ways down the road.
            <br /><br />
            Now time for the progress update, and quite honestly thereâ€™s too much that has changed to fit in this blog so we will keep it short. To start, we have finally gotten around to fixing our building system. For the longest time, we have had the framework in place that worked well enough, but as soon as we introduced the citizen construction of these pieces, things got messy. Finally, this feature feels solid. Additionally, our crafting system has been implemented into our building system, allowing citizens to self-manage placing of chests and other building related items. Our combat system is starting to come together, and while it is still a bit clunky, we will continue to improve upon this feature over the next month so that it will be ready upon the initial release. Of course with the introduction of the combat system, we had to have something to test it on, so we have been piecing together our wildlife system as well.
            <br /><br />
            Additionally, we have been redoing many of our models in the game, which has been a large motivation booster, as we are able to see the game come together, both visually and behind the scenes. To add to this, we have started to rework our UI which really has brought together all of the different components that make up this game. Players are now able to snap to a citizens location, as well as follow them around, view their inventories and edit their task priorities, which really allows for the player to better manage their colony. Wildlife now spawns in the world, however, we have yet to create final modules for these.
            <br /><br />
            There really is just so much to list, but I think that will do it for now. We will see you next month for the inital release of our first public pre-alpha build!
